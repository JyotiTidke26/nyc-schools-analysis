# 🚀 Day 5 – Project Wrap-up & GitHub Deployment

Today’s mission: **move your project to your personal GitHub repository** and make it public. This is your chance to organize and present your work as a complete, professional portfolio project.

You’ll be restructuring, documenting, and finalizing everything from the past four days — with a focus on clarity, code quality, and storytelling.

---

## 🧠 Task Summary

Here’s what to do:

- ✅ **Clone or copy the project to your personal GitHub repo**
  - Create a **new public repository** under your personal account
  - Use a clean, descriptive name like `nyc-schools-analysis` or similar

- ✅ **Restructure your folders** to reflect the *actions* you performed, not the day labels  
  For example:
- 📁 nyc-schools-analysis/ ← Main project folder (GitHub repo root)
├── 📁 incident_analysis/ ← Former Day 1
│ └── README.md ← Explains task + key findings
│ └── data/ ← Any related raw/cleaned data
│
├── 📁 school_directory_exploration/ ← Former Day 2
│ └── README.md ← Task description + insights
│ └── visuals/ ← Bar charts or summaries
│ └── notebook.ipynb
│
├── 📁 database_queries/ ← Former Day 3
│ └── README.md ← SQL queries via Python + outcomes
│ └── queries.ipynb
│
├── 📁 database_population/ ← Former Day 4
│ └── README.md ← Data cleaning + upload logic
│ └── cleaned_data.csv
│ └── upload_script.py
│
├── 📁 assets/ ← Optional: project visuals, screenshots
│
├── requirements.txt ← Dependencies list
├── environment.yml ← (Optional) Conda environment file
├── README.md ← Full project overview and summary

## ✅ What to Submit

## ⏳ Estimated Time

**3–5 hours**

Focus on polish, presentation, and professional delivery. You’ve already done the heavy lifting — now package it into something you're proud to share!

---

## 📣 Final Tip

**Each folder should have its own README** explaining the task and results — and your **main README** should tell the story of the overall project. Treat your documentation like it’s part of your portfolio — because it is. 🧠💬
