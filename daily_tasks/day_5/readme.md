# 🚀 Day 5 – Project Wrap-up & GitHub Deployment

Today’s mission: **move your project to your personal GitHub repository** and make it public. This is your chance to organize and present your work as a complete, professional portfolio project.

You’ll be restructuring, documenting, and finalizing everything from the past four days — with a focus on clarity, code quality, and storytelling.

---

## 🧠 Task Summary

Here’s what to do:

- ✅ **Clone or copy the project to your personal GitHub repo**
  - Create a **new public repository** under your personal account
  - Use a clean, descriptive name like `nyc-schools-analysis` or similar

- ✅ **Restructure your folders** to reflect the *actions* you performed, not the day labels  
  For example:
📁 incident_analysis/
📁 school_directory_exploration/
📁 database_queries/
📁 database_population/


---

## ✅ What to Submit

- Link to your **personal GitHub repository** (must be public)
- Pull Request in the cohort’s GitHub repo
- Comment with both links in:

## ⏳ Estimated Time

**3–5 hours**

Focus on polish, presentation, and professional delivery. You’ve already done the heavy lifting — now package it into something you're proud to share!

## 📣 Final Tip

**Each folder should have its own README** explaining the task and results — and your **main README** should tell the story of the overall project. Treat your documentation like it’s part of your portfolio — because it is. 🧠💬
