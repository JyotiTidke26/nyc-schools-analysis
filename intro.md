## ⚙️ How We Will Work

### 🧩 Daily Task Flow

- You will find **daily folders** in the repository with instructions and tasks.
- Every task will be linked to an **issue** in GitHub that you'll work on and comment on daily.

### 🌿 Branching Structure

- Each intern will work in their **personal branch**:  
  `intern-[your-name]`
  
- For each day’s task, create a **sub-branch** from your personal branch:  
  `intern-[your-name]/day-1`, `intern-[your-name]/day-2`, etc.

- This structure keeps your work isolated and traceable by day.

### 🔁 Pull Request Workflow

- You will submit a **Pull Request (PR)** from your daily sub-branch into your **personal branch**.
- Once the PR is ready, **tag it** with the related issue using `Closes #[issue-number]` or `Relates to #[issue-number]`.

### 👁️‍🗨️ Daily Reviews

- **Each day**, once you’ve submitted your task and the PR, add a **comment to the issue** saying your PR is ready.
- **Anastasia** or **Kai** will review your work and leave feedback.
- Expect timely reviews to help you learn as you go!

## 💬 Tips for Success

- Read the instructions in each day's folder carefully.
- Commit often with meaningful commit messages.
- Keep your PRs focused—one PR per task per day.
- Ask questions by commenting directly in your assigned issue.
- Pay attention to review feedback—it’s here to help you grow!
