## NYC Schools Analysis

### 📌 Overview
This project explores and analyzes various aspects of New York City’s public school system using real-world datasets.  
The goal is to provide actionable insights through **data cleaning, exploratory analysis, database queries, and visual storytelling**.

The analysis covers:
- **Incident patterns** across schools  
- **School directory exploration** (demographics, facilities, etc.)  
- **Database queries** to answer key policy and performance questions  
- **Database population scripts** for reproducible data handling

This project combines **Python, SQL, and Data Visualization** to demonstrate practical data analytics and engineering skills.
